# Git_hub_tutorials
This is all about how to create a github account. Then you creat a repository/folder in github and try to transfer
files from your local computer to the corresponding github folder/repository. 
The processes are defined very simply. You can work via terminal.
You can do the same thing manually by uploading a file or a folder from the desired location in your local computer.
Have a great time!
