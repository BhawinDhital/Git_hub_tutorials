This is the beginner's guide to jump into Github. The following are the steps you should follow to create
some files in your local computer and then move into Github.

1. First create a Github account online.
2.In that account, create a repository: you can write any name. For example: Git_hub_tutorials.
3. Go to your local computer and create a folder/directory and give some name.
You can write any name. For example, say Git_hub. If you are doing all it via
terminal then use: mkdir Git_hub.
4. Create or transfer all files you want to transfer to Github repository in that directory in your
local computer.
5. Go to your github account and look the right side of your repository. There is an option
"clone or download". Clone/copy the link.
6. Go to the terminal. Through terminal go to the corresponding location where you have saved all those files
to upload in the github.
7.In terminal, type : get + clone + clone link(repository link).
Doing this creates a folder/repository inside Git_hub. Now transfer all files to this new folder/repository
inside Git_hub folder. For example, if you have given the repository name in your github account as
"Git_hub_tutorials" then inside Git_hubthere will be a folder named "Git_hub_tutorials" after you clone and run
git  clone link(repository link).
8.copy all files to that repository(Git_hub_tutorials). This means
Type :cp file_name Git_hub_tutorials
9.Type : git status (Typing this command gives red color statement)
10. Type : git add (file_name)
11.Type : git status(it shows green if the file is added)
12. Type : git commit -m "file_name"
13. Type : git push origin master.

You can do the same thing manually. If you decided not going through the terminal, then you can do it
manually, just creating a folder and adding all files in that folder in your local computer.
Then go the Github repository and use upload. You can upload your files from the destination folder.
